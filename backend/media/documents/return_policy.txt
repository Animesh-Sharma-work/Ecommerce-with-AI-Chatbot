Refund & Return Policy for Fusion E-commerce
Effective Date: September 1, 2025

Our Commitment to You
Thank you for shopping at Fusion E-commerce! Our goal is to ensure you are completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason you are not, we are here to help with our straightforward return and refund process.

1. General Return Window
You have 30 calendar days from the date you received your item to initiate a return request.
To be eligible for a return, your item must meet the following criteria:
- It must be unused and in the same condition that you received it.
- It must be in its original packaging, with all tags and accessories included.
- You must have the receipt or proof of purchase (your order number is sufficient).

2. The Return Process: A Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Initiate Your Return
To start a return, please contact our customer support team. The easiest way is through the Support Chat feature on our website. Provide your Order Number and the item(s) you wish to return.

Step 2: Prepare Your Package
Once your return is approved, securely package the item(s) in their original packaging. Include a note with your order number inside the package to help us process your return quickly.

Step 3: Ship Your Item
You are responsible for shipping the item back to the return address provided by our support team. We recommend using a trackable shipping service, as we cannot be held responsible for items lost or damaged in transit. (See Section 6 for details on shipping costs).

3. Non-Returnable Items
Certain types of items cannot be returned, including:
- Gift cards
- Downloadable software products or digital goods
- Some health and personal care items (for hygiene reasons)
- Items marked as "Final Sale" or "Non-Returnable"

4. Refunds
Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will notify you of the status of your refund.
- Approval: If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original method of payment (e.g., your credit card).
- Timeline: Refunds are typically processed within 5–10 business days after approval, but may take longer depending on your card issuer’s policies.
- Rejection: If your return is rejected (e.g., the item is damaged, used, or missing parts), we will contact you to explain the reason and arrange to have the item shipped back to you at your expense.

5. Damaged or Incorrect Items
If you receive an item that is defective, damaged, or incorrect, please contact our Support Chat immediately (within 7 days of receiving the order, or as soon as possible).
- We may require a photo of the damaged or incorrect item.
- We will cover all costs for the return shipping and send you a replacement item at no additional cost. If a replacement is not available, we will issue a full refund.

6. Return Shipping Costs
- For standard returns (e.g., you changed your mind), you will be responsible for paying your own shipping costs. These shipping costs are non-refundable.
- For returns due to our error (e.g., damaged, defective, or incorrect item), we will provide you with a prepaid shipping label and cover all associated costs.

7. Exchanges
Currently, we do not process direct exchanges. The fastest way to ensure you get the item you want is to return the item you have and, once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.

8. Policy Updates
Fusion E-commerce reserves the right to modify this Refund & Return Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page.

9. Legal Compliance
This policy does not override or limit your rights under applicable consumer protection laws in your country or state. Where such laws provide you with additional rights, those rights will apply.
